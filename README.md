# ARCHBLOX-APP
ARCHBLOX App is a client for the site which can connect to it using APIs. You cannot play or make games using this app. This is designed to be able to ported to platforms which do not have Roblox client versions that match the one used on site, for example: MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, etc. Right now, there is only MacOS, iOS and iPadOS in development, with other operating system/versions on the way.

MacOS System requirements:
- MacOS 11.0 or newer
- 64 bit ARM or Intel
iOS/iPadOS System requirements:
- iOS 14.0 or newer
- iPadOS 14.0 or newer
- 64 bit ARM

Planned operating system support (if possible, probability is shown in brackets next to name):
- 32 bit iOS (as low as iPhoneOS 3 to maximise compatability, high possibility)
- 32 bit Mac OS X, PowerPC Mac OS X (high possibility)
- Android 32 bit, 64 bit. (medium possibility)
- Linux (medium possibility)
- Windows RT (low possibility)
- Windows Phone (low possibility)
- Wii (low possibility)
- Wii U (low possibility)
- 3DS (low possibility)

If you wish to help out, documentation will be added in the future on how to make your own versions.

To build the ARCHBLOX xcodeproj, you need xCode 14.0 or newer.
